# CS250-Sprint-Review
•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

After gathering data through surveys, interviews and meetings, I collate this data into short, actionable stories that can be directly translated into a feature or modification for a particular application. These User Stories help provide clear, end-user feedback about my ongoing development process. They also help developers prioritize features that are important to the customer and encourage continuous collaboration. 

•	How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I like to get as much information from the customers about their needs for a product or application upfront and utilize agile methodologies to remain flexible and accommodate any changes that may come up during the development process. The Agile processes that I like to incorporate the most are the emphasis on communication and collaboration, the iterative sprint cycles, and the team organization that allows the developers to continue working on critical tasks instead of getting pulled into redundant or irrelevant meetings. 

•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means maintaining strong communication and collaboration with the rest of the team, taking ownership of your work and meeting deadlines, and supporting your team in developing clean code responsibly.
